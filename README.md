groupId: Integer ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different matches, they will have a different groupId each time

KillPlace: Ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.

kills: Number of enemy players killed.
killStreaks: Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.
longestKill: Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a - player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.
maxPlace: Worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.
numGroups: Number of groups we have data for in the match.
revives: Number of times this player revived teammates.

winPoints: Win-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only winning matters.)
winPlacePerc: The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups, so it is possible to have missing chunks in a match.
